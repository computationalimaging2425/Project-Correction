\begin{frame}{Problem Description}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The project analyzes the performance of two \textbf{Projection-Correction} algorithms for reconstructing medical images affected by \textbf{motion blur}.
    \item The studied algorithms are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS)}
      \item \textbf{Regularization by Denoising with Diffusion (RED-Diff)}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Both methods are based on \textbf{pre-trained diffusion models}.
    \item Objective: evaluate the effectiveness of these methods in recovering degraded images.
  \end{itemize}
